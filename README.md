# ItPrepMate - Your Tech Career Prep Companion

## Project Background

As newcomers to Canada pursuing careers in tech, we realized the unique challenges faced by others in similar situations. We found that many of the resources available for job search and interview preparation were scattered, making it difficult for newcomers to navigate the job market effectively.

Motivated by our own experiences and the desire to support others in their career journeys, we created **ItPrepMate** ‚Äî a one-stop platform tailored specifically to help IT professionals new to Canada. Our goal is to simplify the process of finding jobs, preparing for interviews, and building strong networks, providing newcomers with the tools and confidence they need to succeed in Canada‚Äôs competitive tech industry.

This project was developed as the final project for the **Women in Technology** program by [ACCES Employment](https://accesemployment.ca/programs/programs-for-women/women-in-technology), an initiative focused on empowering newcomer women in tech by providing them with the skills and support needed to excel in their careers.
